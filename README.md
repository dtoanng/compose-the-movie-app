#### A simple The Movie App üì± built to demonstrate the use of modern android architecture component with MVVM Architecture üèó

The App is using the [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org) built with Jetpack Compose and MVVM architecture.

### Build With üèóÔ∏è
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Programming language for Android
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Android‚Äôs modern toolkit for building native UI.
- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection)
    - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt) - Easier way to incorporate Dagger DI into Android apps.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
    - [Paging3](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) - The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - A logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.

### Project Architecture üóº
- This app uses [MVVM (Model ComposableView View-Model)] architecture
- Repository pattern
- Hilt - dependency injection
